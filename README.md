# Datathon

### Project Steps and Objectives

#### Data Integration and Risk Evaluation

- ** Objective**: Combine Census and FEMA data to evaluate populations of lower-income families living in high-risk coastal flooding zones.
- **Details**:
  - Utilize FEMA data, which includes various categories for measuring different types of natural disasters.
  - Focus on a pared-down list of categories, but keep additional categories to potentially model other prevalent risk factors like hurricanes.
  - Experimentation with the data is encouraged to identify potentially vulnerable populations.

#### Identifying Relocation Areas

- **Objective**: Identify areas in the city where stakeholders could rehouse displaced families.
- **Strategy**:
  - **a.** Consider the income levels of different parts of the city to find areas where socio-economic conditions are similar to those of the displaced families, thus avoiding NIMBY issues.
  - **b.** Focus on tracts with median incomes, total populations, and lower potential flood risks.
  - **c.** Aim to find relocation tracts similar to the original tracts but with much lower risks of flooding.

### Considerations

- Ensure that the relocation strategies take into account the socio-economic compatibility of the communities to prevent opposition from existing residents against new housing developments.
- Continuously update and refine data models based on new data and feedback from ongoing assessments of risk and community responses.
